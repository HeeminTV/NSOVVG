# NSOVVG - Not Serious Oscilloscope View Video Generator
**NSOVVG** is a simple oscilloscope view video render that is written in batch script.

Although written in a poor programming language, it provides a pseudo-GUI by including user-friendly features such as a channel selection window and color picker.

[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) should be installed in your [system path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)#DOS,_OS/2,_and_Windows) or the same directory.
